# Shopping Helper
## What is that?

POC project of static functions that are thought to be needed in the shopping concept.

## How to run it?

* Since it is a library project, it cannot be run directly.  Therefore, you can run and debug the project over the test project using a .NET compatible IDE (Example: Visual Studio 2022).
* If you don't want to run it through the IDE and dotnet command is defined on your computer, you can start all the tests by running the ``dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"`` command on the main folder of the project.

> :warning: **Note**: If dotnet is not installed on your computer, you can install it by following the instructions in this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/).
